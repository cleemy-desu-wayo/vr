# Static Files for VRChat Client

this is GitHub Pages repository for https://cleemy-desu-wayo.github.io/vr/

https://cleemy-desu-wayo.github.io/vr/ is not a place where I (cleemy Desu wayo) distribute my creations, but a place where I store files for checking the behavior of the VRChat client. Even if the "Allow Untrusted URLs" setting is turned off (Disabled), the VRChat client can still access the files.

Even VRChat running on Linux (+ Proton Experimental) may be able to play the following URLs with video players in VRChat worlds.
